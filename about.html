			<h2> About StanLearn </h2>
			<p><b> What is StanLearn? </b></p></br>
			<p> StanLearn is the next big thing in language learning! In it's current state, 
			StanLearn aims to assist users 
			as best as possible in learning a new European language! </p>
			<p> Currently, there are four languages you can choose to start learning, each 
			having four different topics and their own wordlist! These
			languages are: </p>
			<li>French</li>	
			<li>German</li>
			<li>Spanish</li>
			<li>Swedish</li>
			<p> The different topics you can choose to start learning are animals, numbers, colours and food!
			these languages are popular first choices for people who wish to learn a second language in Europe
			, and so I felt it appropriate to allow you to start right here!
			StanLearn was created from the years 2017-2018 by Nathan Stanley. </p>
